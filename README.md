# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

-- This project was a huge stepping stone in terms of learning about the tendencies of web development. As a person who has barely touched CSS and HTML, completing this project was an eye-opener and allowed me to develop my skills in the front-end department. The project also showed me how tough front-end development can get! Overall, an enjoyable project and will help continue my path towards a full developer.
